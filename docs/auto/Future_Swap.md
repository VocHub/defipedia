## Future Swap

### Background

after the introduction of stock tokens, they were traded with a premium. The prices on the DEX were higher than the prices from the oracle. To fight this premium (but also a possible discount) the future swaps were introduced with DFIP-2203-A.

<https://github.com/DeFiCh/dfips/issues/127>

This swap is executed once a week (every 7\*2880 blocks). You can buy for + 5% of the oracle price or sell for -5% of the oracle price, even if the Price is higher/lower than that 5%. Buy or sell means swapping to/from DUSD.

### Scheduling

On defiscan.live you can find a countdown to the next future swap block via the link

<https://defiscan.live/blocks/countdown/NextFutureSwap>

In the desktop wallet you can check the next future swap block using the command **getfutureswapblock**

To quickly check for the current premium of the stock tokens you can use the dStocks Quickcheck page at

<https://dstocks-defichain.web.app/>

On defichain analytics you can also follow the premium over time in a chart

### Strategy

With this measure the price of the dTokens can be held in a +-5% corridor. In case of a higher premium or discount it can get arbitraged. For the case of a premium the following trade can be done

- Mint a dToken using a vault (take a loan)
- The collateralization ratio gets calculated using the oracle price (real price without premium)
- Sell the minted dToken on the DEX (swap to DUSD)
- Because of the premium, you get extra DUSD
- Do a future swap using the received DUSD to buy the dToken back paying the oracle price (cheaper because it's without premium)
- When the future Swap gets executed you will receive more dToken than you minted
- The loan (minted dToken) can be paid back and the additional dToken will stay in the wallet as a profit

### Future Swap in the Light Wallet

### Future Swap in the Desktop Wallet

In the console view of the desktop wallet you can use the command **futureswap**.

Syntax:

```abap
futureswap "address" "amount" ( "destination" [{"txid":"hex","vout":n},...] )
```

For example to swap 500 DUSD to Netflix token:

```abap
futureswap "dVvPfdjhfdjhfjd32dPWZoNYno7uBUn1KyU" "500@DUSD" dNFLX)
```

Using the command **getpendingfutureswaps** you can check which future swaps have alread been set for a given address.

```abap
getpendingfutureswaps "address"
```
