description: The Lightwallet is the most used mobile app to access the DeFiChain ecosystem. IOS and Android. Easy to install and use. Basic functions explained.
---

## Background and general infos

The most common wallet for DeFiChain, the so called light wallet is the app for mobile devices “DeFiChain Wallet“. You find it on the google app store for Android or apples app store for iOs devices.

<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.defichain.app>

<https://apps.apple.com/app/defichain-wallet/id1572472820>

The app is developed and actively maintained by Birthday Research – the R&D (Research and Development) arm of Cake DeFi <https://birthday.dev/>

The app gets updated frequently so always check if you are using the latest version.

As the name already tells you, it is a light wallet. So, it does not require a full node having the whole blockchain data downloaded. Instead, an API is used to connect to servers that provides this data – on the DeFiChain this is the so called ocean API. You can specify the endpoint you want to use in the setting as described in the article [Lightwallet change Ocean](./Lightwallet_change_Ocean.md)

Everytime you want to do a transaction on the blockcahin (like for example sending or swapping coins) you will have to provide your passcode. While the transaction is processed you see an information pop up in the lower end of the app. There is also a link to open the transaction on defiscan.info. You have to wait until a transaction was finished to be able to sign the next one.

## App Overview

Here is a detailed user guide for the light wallet.

The interface of the Light Wallet consists of 4 major categories. You can switch between those categories with the buttons at the bottom of the app.

- Portfolio
- DEX
- Loans
- Auctions

### Portfolio

This is the main screen where you have an overview of the assets in your wallet.

_Main screen - portfolio_  
![Main screen - portfolio](./../media/lwguide_EN_mainscreen.png)

1.  You can go to the settings from here (cogwheel at the top left)
2.  You can select the network (MainNet, [TestNet](./Testnet.md) or Playground) with the button on the top right. This button is visible on all tabs, so you always see at one glance if you are on the MainNet
3.  You can add multiple Adresses to you wallet. Each address will get a generated icon and it is possible to label each address. The labels can help to organize your addresses but are not shared on the blockchain and not visible to others. By clicking the icon or the label you get a pop up window where you can organize your addresses (add additional ones or rename them) and select the address you want to use in the wallet. The popup also lets you copy the addresses to the clipboard.
4.  With the Eye button you can toggle if the amounts and values of the assets are shown. For example, if you are using the wallet in public like on a train and some stranger sits beside you - you might want to hide the values.
5.  The total worth of assets in this address. By clicking you can choose the reference currency in which the total but also all other positions in the wallet are displayed. The available options are
    - BTC - Bitcoin
    - DUSD - The stablecoin on the DeFiChain
    - USDC – USD Coin, it is an ERC-20-Tokens issued by the Centre consortium
    - USDT – Tether, an ERC-20-Tokens issued by Tether Limited, when using Tether as reference currency the dollar sign is used in all amounts over the app
    - DFI – The native coin of the DeFiChain
6.  With the little arrow you can show or hide the details on how the total worth is calculated. This is especially helpful when you are using vaults as the details show how much is in the collateral (locked in vaults) and how much loans sum up as debit
7.  Send Button - forwards you to the send screen, described in detail bellow
8.  Receive Button - shows the current address on the DeFiChain, lets you copy this address in to the clipboard to be able to paste it in nother app. The address is also shown as a QR code that lets you scan the address with another devices camera.
9.  Swap Button- forwards you to the swap screen for trading one kind of token to another via the liquidity pools on the DEX, described in detail bellow
10. Transactions - shows you the history of transactions of the current address on the blockchain. You can look up details for every transaction directly in the app or use a link to the transaction on defiscan.live
11. Filter displayed Assets in the Portfolio. Available are the options
    - All tokens – show everything you got in the portfolio
    - dTokens – show DUSD and all stock tokens (like dTesla for Tesla or dMSTR for Microstrategy)
    - Crypto – show he dAssets representing crypto currencies like dBTC for Bitcoin or dETH for Etherium
    - LP tokens – show just the positions in liquidity mining pools (no matter if crypto or stocks) No matter which one of the 4 filters you choose, you will always see your DFI position on top.
12. Here you can select the order in which the positions of the portfolio are listed. You can select ascending or descending by value (in the chosen reference currency mentioned in point 5), by amount of token or alphabetically.

#### Send

With the Send button (Nr 7 on the main screen - Portfolio) you are forwarded to an interface where you can send any token in your portfolio (no matter if crypto, stock token or even pool token) to another address.

_Send screen_  
![Send screen](./../media/lwguide_EN_send.png)

1.  Back arrow - you can always cancel the current sending and go back to the previous screen
2.  The amount (number of token) you want to send
3.  The value of the amount to send in the reference currency, gets updated while you type the amount (2)
4.  The token you want to send, default when opening is DFI, when you click on it you can choose from all the token you have in the wallet. You are also informed about the amount of the token that you have available in the current address
5.  Presets for amounts, you can directly choose with these four presets 25, 50, 75 or 100 percent of the token that are available in the current address
6.  DeFiChain Address of the receiver, a text field where you can paste an address that you have in the clipboard, such an address starts with d followed by lots of characters and numbers
7.  Choose an address from your address book. In the settings menu (cogwheel on the main screen - Portfolio) you can add addresses to a whitelist and provide a label for each of these bookmarked addresses. Here in the send screen, you can choose from your whitelisted addresses and also all the addresses that you have in your wallet.
8.  Scan QR code – this lets you use the camera of your device to scan a QR code that represents an address on the DeFiChain
9.  Continue – as soon as you have specified the amount you want to send and a valid receiver you can continue. You will have to provide your passcode. A new passcode can be set in the settings menu (cogwheel on the main screen - Portfolio). It is a six-digit numeric passcode that you set when initializing the wallet. If you lose your passcode, you will not be able to authorize any transaction. In the worst case you can still access your funds with another wallet if you still have your 24 recovery words.

#### Swap

_LightWallet-Swap screen_  
![LightWallet-Swap screen](./../media/lwguide_EN_swap.png)

1.  Back arrow - you can always cancel the current swap and go back to the previous screen

11. Value A - the value of the amount to sell in the reference currency, gets updated while you type the amount (6 or 10)
12. Slippage – here you can define the maximum amount of slippage you want to accept in that trade. There are presets of 0.5, 1 or 3 percent or you can also enter a custom value. The slippage is a kind of fee that depends on the size of your trade compared to the liquidity in the used pools. Best try your swap with a small slippage tolerance first to avoid high fees. If the transaction fails – you will see that as an error message in the app – you can still, try with a higher tolerance or smaller amount. Trading huge amounts is best split up in chunks and wait for the pool to rebalance between the separate transactions.
13. Info about the exchange rates - how much token of type B do you get for one token of type A and vice versa. As soon as you have specified the amount, token types and accepted slippage you can click continue to perform the transaction.
