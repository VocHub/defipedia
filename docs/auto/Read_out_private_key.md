Description of how the private key can be read out of the app.

![Copy the DFI address to which you want to read the private key](./../media/readprivatekey_EN_01.png)

Copy the DFI address to which you want to read the private key.

Go to [dex.defichain.com](https://dex.defichain.com/) and search for this address.

Note: The website operator can theoretically link your IP address with this DFI address. It may be useful to use a VPN or a TOR browser.

_Check if this address really contains all coins!_

_Go to the console and Unlock your wallet._

Go to the console.

Enter the following command: `dumpprivkey `_`"your address"`_.

> _Note_: For reading the native BTC private key instead of a DFI key, use command `spv_dumpprivkey `_`"your address"`_ instead. You can use the BTC key for example in Electrum, see here: [Import BTC private key to Electrum](./Import_BTC_private_key_to_Electrum.md).

Confirm with Enter ‚èé

(Should I explain here where the Enter key is located?)
