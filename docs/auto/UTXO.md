description: DeFiChain uses the UTXO model. Differences between DFI in form of Token and UTXO.
---

DeFiChain uses the **u**nspent transaction (**tx**) **o**utput model, or
UTXO. There are two types of DFI, UTXO and token. UTXO DFI can be spent
(sent to another wallet) through the blockchain; it is a user's
available balance. The other form of DFI, token DFI, is received in
liquidity mining. Because in every block, which occurs approximately
every 30 seconds, rewards are distributed to liquidity providers,
creating tons of UTXO transactions would be inefficient, spamming the
blockchain with transactions, and raising the cost of a transaction that
would make it unprofitable to liquidity mine. So, rewards are instead
distributed by token, which does not include a transaction fee. Token
DFI must be converted to UTXO DFI before it is possible to send any DFI.
