##### Export to Cointracking: {#export-to-cointracking}

**Cumulate All:**

All DFI income of the day (rewards and commission from each pool pair) is cumulated into one income and the other commission pool pair (BTC, ETH etc...) -\> 1 income for DFI and X (number of pool pairs) income per day -\> **1 + X (number of pool pair) transactions per day**

Example: BTC-DFI, ETH-DFI

1 reward & commission income DFI, 1 ETH commission income and 1 BTC commission income

**Cumulated Poolpair:**

All DFI income of the day from each Pool Pair (rewards and commission from each pool pair) is cumulated into X (number of pool pairs) income and the other commission pool pair (BTC, ETH etc...) -\> **2 + X (number of pool pair) transactions per day**

Example: BTC-DFI, ETH-DFI

1 reward income DFI , 1 commission income DFI , 1 commission BTC and 1 commission ETH

**Cumulated Rewards and Commissions:**

All DFI income of the day is cumulated into two income (rewards and commissions) and the other commission pool pair (BTC, ETH etc...) -\> 2 income for DFI and X (number of pool pairs) income per day. **2 \* X (number of pool pair) transactions per day**

Example: BTC-DFI, ETH-DFI

1 reward & commission income DFI (BTC-DFI) and 1 commission BTC

1 reward & commission income DFI (ETH-DFI) and 1 commission ETH

**Cumulated None:**

All incomes for each pool pair, rewards and commissions are daily cummulated -\> 2 income DFI for each pool pair and X (number of pool pair) commission for each pool pair. **3 \* X (number of pool pair) transactions per day**

Example: BTC-DFI, ETH-DFI

1 reward income DFI from BTC-DFI pool, 1 commission income DFI from BTC-DFI pool, 1 commission income BTC

1 reward income DFI from ETH-DFI pool, 1 commission income DFI from ETH-DFI pool, 1 commission income ETH
