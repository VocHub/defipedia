title: Target multiplier
description: Target multiplier is to ensure that the DFI rewards are fairly distributed between all DeFiChain masternodes.
---

This number represents the probability of a DeFiChain masternode minting the next block. The higher the number gets, the likelier the masternode will mint a block. It's like adding up lottery tickets.

After starting a masternode or after it has minted a block, the target multiplier is set to 1. It's value increases by 1 every 6 hours. Maximum can be as high as 57.

This mechanism ensures that masternodes which have not minted a block for a long time will have a higher chance of minting the next one.
